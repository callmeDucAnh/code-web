        A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is
    believed it takes about $0 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the comer of the eyes,
     an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
